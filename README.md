# Your first Plotly animation
### Rep V 1.0.2

This public repository is dedicated to my "Your first Plotly animation" blogpost and contains all the data, code and images used throughout the post. However - this is only the beginning!

I'm already working on the next tutorial for more advanced Plotly users on some tips 'n tricks :)

Looking to get involved and help with this series - or maybe collaborate on a different project? Contact me on any of the listed platforms ^_^ 


_Here is a quick guide on how to navigate the current version of the rep:_

There are 3 folders:

1. Images: Contains images used within the post. Exception being [this image](https://github.com/Alex-Caian/Plotly_demo/blob/main/Images/starseek.png) which was custom generated for [this figure](https://github.com/Alex-Caian/Plotly_demo/blob/main/Code/Radar_script.py) to give it a feel for how plotly can be used for businesses. Feel free to use the logo without any citation or credits!
2. Code: There are 2 files. [This file](https://github.com/Alex-Caian/Plotly_demo/blob/main/Code/Radar_script.py) is a script for producing figure 0, whilst [this one](https://github.com/Alex-Caian/Plotly_demo/blob/main/Code/Plotly%20Demo.ipynb) is a notebook file presenting the code for figures 1 through 4 from the blog.
3. Data: For figure 0 there was also a custom dataset used. Processing, anon & generation code haven't been included, but the data used for figure 0 is [available there](https://github.com/Alex-Caian/Plotly_demo/blob/main/Data/Demo_data_plotly.csv)
